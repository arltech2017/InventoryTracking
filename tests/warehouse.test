We will need to be able to generate a catalog of footwear for testing purposes,
and to read and write the catalog to a file so that the same catalog can be
used repeatedly. Let's choose some names for the functions that will do this.

  >>> from warehouse import *

Now we need to be able to make a catalog, save it, and read it back in.

  >>> cat1 = database.make_catalog(5)
  >>> database.save_catalog(cat1, 'cat.dat')
  >>> cat2 = database.get_catalog('cat.dat')

Now we need to verify that the two catalogs contain the 'same' stuff.

  >>> cat1[0] == cat2[0]
  True
